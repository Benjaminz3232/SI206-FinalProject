Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?
>For the final project, I will be working on option 2, which will deal with APIS
specifically of Twitter and OMDB.




IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:



* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:




* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you
will be getting data from.




* Why are you proposing this project?




* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what
information will it contain?




* What are your concerns about this proposal?




-----



THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are
choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)



* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?




>One of the classes that I will be defining will be called "Movie."


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
>The class Movie will take a dictionary of movie data which will be fetched using
the getMovieData function which I will be making to grab data from OMDB using API.



* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
>An instance of the class Movie will represent a singular movie (and the data 
associated with that particular movie) along with instance variables and methods.






* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called,
and what information will they hold? Why are they important?




>Three of the instance variables that the class Movie will contain will be of the
title of the movie (called "title"), director(s) of the movie (called "directors")
and the actors that played in the film (called "actors").


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor
(__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each.

ONE METHOD:

- What will the name of the method be?



__str__


- What will the method do?
>The method __str__ prints the movie's title, director(s) and actors in a readable
format (one line hopefully).





- Will it take any additional input?
>This method will take no additional inputs.





- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an
instance variable?
>This method will return a string containing the title of the movie and its
director(s), and it will not be changing any instance variables.


- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?




>This particular method is going to be useful for presenting the user with the
movie's title and director(s) in a user-friendly format (aka readable).



ANOTHER METHOD:

- What will the name of the method be?



>getActors


- What will the method do?
>The getActors method will return the number of actors in a particular movie in
a list.





- Will it take any additional input? 


>The getActors method will take an integer as input


- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance
variable? 



>


- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third
time, because you'll have to do so eventually when you write documentation!]






* What will the tables in your database be?







* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key?
You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:

- text ... 

(etc.)








* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one
should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're
interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples,
maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has
favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been
favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")






* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use?







* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and
proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension").
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for
everyone!<<<







* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something
else? What information will it contain?
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for
everyone!<<<
